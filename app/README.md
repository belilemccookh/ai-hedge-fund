## 🚀 Quick Start (For Non-Technical Users)

**One-line setup and run command:**

### Option 1: Using 1-Line Shell Script (Recommended)

#### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
./run.sh
```

If you get a "permission denied" error, run this first:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

Or alternatively, you can run:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
run.bat
```

### Option 2: Using npm (Alternative)
```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run setup
```

**That's it!** These scripts will:
1. Check for required dependencies (Node.js, Python, Poetry)
2. Install all dependencies automatically
3. Start both frontend and backend services
4. **Automatically open your web browser** to the application

**Requirements:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Python 3](https://python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

**After running, you can access:**
- Frontend (Web Interface): http://localhost:5173
